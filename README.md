# carta_robot_test
This repo contains tests using "robotframework" and "robotframework-seleniumlibrary". 

# Prerequisite
The following packages/libraries/modules need to be installed in your test environment:

* robotframework (https://robotframework.org)
* robotframework-seleniumlibrary (https://github.com/robotframework/SeleniumLibrary/)
* (optional) webdrivermanager (https://github.com/rasjani/webdrivermanager)
* Pillow (https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/)
* convert (ImageMagick; https://imagemagick.org/index.php)
* (optional) psrecord (https://github.com/astrofrog/psrecord)
* a set of test image data (upon request)

It is recommended to install "robotframework", "robotframework-seleniumlibrary" and "webdrivermanager" via `conda`. "webdrivermanager" is a handy tool to install webdrivers such as chromedriver or geckodriver (Firefox).

"Pillow" and "convert" are required for test validation. 

"psrecord" is required for CPU and RAM monitoring tests.
